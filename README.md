# CSS Autogenerator

A simple script to automatically generate .css files from a very simple syntax. Accepts inputs as either a file, command line arguments, or from a basic command line text editor.

## To run

To run the program, simply clone the repository and run `p0.py`. To run the program with fancy text using blessed, run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` before running the program.
